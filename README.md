#Regarding the submission
The .ipynb file that will confirm our results is the reproduce_data.ipynb found in the root directory. We have confirmed that it works by running it on Windows.

The code found in the additional_code, represents most of the code we've written, it exists within the team_template folder, and in the root directory, but in order to have it easily available for review it is also found there. There are parts of the provided code that have been altered as well. Several alterations have been made to train.py, including the addition of a loss function. 

Code is available at: \
https://gitlab.com/Ajulvi18/ikt460-reinforcement-learning-project \
and:  
https://github.com/Ajulvi18/Ikt452_computer_vision_project

Gitlab was used for main version control, github repo added later due to submission instructions
